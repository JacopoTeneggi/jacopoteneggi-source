At Prof. Dzakpasu's Lab, I study spontaneous neuronal activity as a function of time in embryonic hippocampal-cell networks from APOE-2 and APOE-4 mouse breeds. I develop MATLAB analysis tools, synthesizing my computer science, physics, and signal processing knowledge.

I apply statistical mechanics, applied thermodynamics, and information theory to detect the presence or absence of synchrony in the cultures, transforming time-series of spiking events recorded from a microelectrode array.

Our goal is to characterize the effects of different APOE treatments on information transmission and entropy generation rate in neuronal networks.
