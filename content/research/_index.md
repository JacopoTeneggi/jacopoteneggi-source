I always turn my ideas into lines of code. With my research, I work to merge my passion for data science, image processing, and signal analysis with biomedical engineering. As a member of POLITO's “Giovani Talenti,” a merit-based track reserved for the top 4% of undergraduates across all majors, I explore a broad variety of disciplines. I grasp the nature of biological processes from different points of view, so I can formulate hypotheses and independently build the creative analytical tools to test them.

How can I use this ability to innovate modern healthcare? How can medical data guide MDs in uncertain diagnoses and support decision-making? How can data analysis tools provide patients with precise, tailored medicine? How can predictive models halt ineffective treatments? I want to find answers to these questions.
